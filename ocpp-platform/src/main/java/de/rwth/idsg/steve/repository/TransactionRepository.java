     * StopTransaction is received. Are these values null because the charging process is still going on or the station
     * did not send a StopTransaction message since it has connectivity issues and is therefore offline? The latter
     * causes us problems, because a StopTransaction might arrive a long time after the charging process actually ends.
     * Therefore, we have to consider that multiple stations might have active transactions for the same ocppIdTag.
